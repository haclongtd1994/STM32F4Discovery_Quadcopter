//Sensor ITG-3205
/* Note: could PEC positioning help ensure correctness?
 * Note: The 9DOF sensor has internal resistors
 * Note: the power (SDA, SCL, VDD) lines on the i2c bus should be checked for random voltage spikes. I have heard reports a tantalum cap might be needed
 * Note that typically as you increase range sensitivity suffers causing reduced resolution.
 * Note that a gyro suffers from drift error. Note that temperature greatly affects the drift.
 * One way to calibrate is whenever you know the quadcopter is stationary, zero out the current measured values.
 * Note: on startup, we should zero out what is measured. Apparently a "zero" position is a "stressful" position for the device,
 *   each individual sensor will have different readings. Just average the first few readings.
 * Note: I probably shouldn't be afraid of longish (seconds) startup time. It may lead to better bias averaging.
 * Initial ZRO Tolerance is + / - 40 degrees / second. This depends a lot on temperature.
